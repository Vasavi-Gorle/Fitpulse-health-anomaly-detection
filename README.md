Tile: Detecting Unusual Health Patterns Using Fitness Device

With the surge in wearable fitness devices, a vast amount of health-related time-series data is generated daily. Yet, users and healthcare providers often fail to notice subtle early warning signs of health anomalies like irregular heartbeats, sleep disturbances, or abnormal activity levels. This project leverages Al-based anomaly detection to intelligently analyze fitness watch data and flag unusual health patterns. By enabling proactive health monitoring, it supports preventive healthcare and personalized wellness insights.

1. The project focuses on detecting health anomalies from fitness device data.

2. Data sources include heart rate, steps, and sleep patterns.

3. Data is generated and stored in CSV and JSON formats.

4. Python scripts create sample datasets for testing.

5. Pandas is used to load and manage the data.

6. Missing values and errors in data are cleaned.

7. Timestamps are converted into a proper time format.

8. Data is normalized for smooth analysis.

9. Heart rate averages and sudden spikes are extracted.

10. Step count activity levels are measured.

11. Sleep duration and sleep quality are analyzed.

12. Machine learning models are applied for anomaly detection.

13. Algorithms like Decision Tree and Isolation Forest can be used.

14. Abnormal values are flagged as possible health risks.

15. Visualization tools like Matplotlib show trends clearly.

15. Graphs display heart rate changes, step counts, and sleep cycles.

16. A Streamlit dashboard can be added for real-time monitoring.

17. The system generates alerts such as unusual heart rate warnings.

18. The project supports personal health monitoring.

19. It can also be integrated with real wearable fitness devices.
